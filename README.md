### Hello there!,Welcome to my Github Profile. Great to see you here! üëã üòÉ

I'm Dushyanth Reddy, a graduate with a Master's in Data Science at Indiana University Bloomington,Indiana [https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html], were i developed a strong foundation in machine learning, statistics, and programming languages such as Python, R, Spark and Postgresql. I have worked as Research Assistant in GARYFALLIDIS RESEARCH GROUP [https://grg.luddy.indiana.edu//] where i  Collaborated with esteemed researchers to optimize the V-Net deep learning model for 3D brain MRI segmentation, achieving an exceptional Dice score of 98% and extracting valuable insights from complex brain images. Developed an innovative knowledge distillation technique, compressing the EVAC+ Teacher Model by 60% and enhancing inference speed by 40%, resulting in faster segmentations for the student model.Leading ongoing efforts to further optimize the model, focusing on enhancing both speed and accuracy for superior performance. I'm a Machine Learning Engineer [LLM's] üë®‚Äçüíª  with a passion for Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAGs) and AI Agents (AGI), working on multiple projects mainly DQA Interview Chatbot using Langchain and LlamaIndex. In my free time, I enjoy "participating in Kaggle competitions" and "contributing to open-source data science projects".<br/>
